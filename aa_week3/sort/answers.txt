sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because when testing with the sorted file, it was faster than sort3, as it has omega(n) best case

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because using O(nlogn) is faster than O(n^2). As merge sort uses the former, and its real time is the fastest, its most likely sort2

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: process of elimination, but it takes long to sort a sorted file becasue it has omega(n^2) best case
