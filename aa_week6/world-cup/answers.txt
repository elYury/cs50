Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
Everything was expected, a massive increase in time. As N increased the difference in the top winners didnt change as much, the more the simulation runs the closer it will get to the rating list in the csv file

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
well i would use all the computing power they give me for free (not reaching one second), therefore on N = 125500 on my machine. Additionally i wouldnt say that the predictions are good. the data we put in is not accurate, there are many more parameters to winning a worldcup. Plus this data is quite bad, Belgium has the second highest rating, but they have never actualy won the WC.
